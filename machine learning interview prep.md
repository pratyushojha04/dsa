# Machine Learning Interview Questions

This repository contains a list of machine learning practical coding questions and detailed answers to help with interview preparation. The questions cover a range of core concepts in machine learning.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Details:**
- **Bias**: Error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias indicates underfitting, where the model is too simplistic and fails to capture the underlying pattern.
